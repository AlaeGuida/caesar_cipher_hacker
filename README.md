# Caesar Cipher Hacker

This program can hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher from Project [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/alaeguida/caesar_cipher), even if you don’t know the key. There are only 26 possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and display the results to the user. In cryptography, we call this technique a "brute-force attack"
